## 📋 Abstract  
Online reviews heavily influence consumer choices, and Yelp ratings directly affect restaurant visibility and success.  
This project investigates whether **structured metadata**—price range, amenities, hours, and location—can predict restaurant ratings *without* text reviews.  

Using the **2024 Yelp Open Dataset**, we analyzed **36,261 restaurants** with **61 engineered features**, framing prediction as a **binary classification problem** (≥4★ vs. <4★).  
Models: Logistic Regression, Elastic Net, Random Forest, and XGBoost (Scikit-learn pipeline, 5-fold CV, MLflow tracking).  

**Key Results:**
- **XGBoost:** Highest Accuracy (0.733) and ROC-AUC (0.79)  
- **Random Forest:** Best F1-score (0.659)  
- **Top Predictors:** Review count, price range, operating hours, and accessibility/amenities (wheelchair access, table service)  
- **Clustering (K-Prototypes, k=3):** Identified family-casual, mid-range social, and quick-service archetypes  

**Conclusion:** Structured business metadata effectively predicts Yelp ratings and offers actionable insights for small restaurants to enhance service quality, accessibility, and customer satisfaction.

## 📊 Data Sources  
**Dataset:** [Yelp Open Dataset 2024](https://www.yelp.com/dataset)  

- **Files Used:**  
  - `business.json` – metadata (categories, ratings, price range, amenities)  
  - `review.json` – subset of reviews (2019–2022)  

- **Final Sample:**  
  36,261 restaurants, 61 engineered features  

### 🧹 Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering  
- Log-transformed review counts (`log1p`)  
- Extracted weekly/average hours, weekend hours, and open days  
- Expanded nested attributes → 22 engineered features  
- Encoded categorical fields: Wi-Fi, Alcohol, Attire, Noise Level, Price Range  
- Removed label leakage (e.g., name, postal_code, stars)  
- Top 20 cuisine categories represented with tri-state indicators  
- Aggregated reviews (mean stars, word length, short-review ratio)

## ⚙️ Methods  
Supervised Learning Algorithms:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Elastic Net**  
- **Random Forest**  
- **XGBoost**

Unsupervised Clustering:  
- **K-Prototypes** (handles mixed data types; Euclidean + dissimilarity matching)

**Pipeline:**  
- Scikit-learn `ColumnTransformer` with imputation, scaling, and encoding  
- Hyperparameter tuning via Randomized Search (5-fold stratified CV)  
- Metrics: Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC  
- MLflow for experiment logging & comparison

## 📈 Results  

| Model | Accuracy | F1 Score | ROC-AUC |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.690 | 0.648 | 0.760 |
| Elastic Net | 0.677 | 0.638 | 0.760 |
| Random Forest | 0.723 | **0.659** | 0.787 |
| XGBoost | **0.733** | 0.638 | **0.787** |

**Interpretation:**
- Ensemble models outperform linear ones  
- Nonlinear feature interactions drive satisfaction prediction  
- Metadata alone provides strong predictive signal  

### 🔍 Feature Importance  
Top predictors (Random Forest & Logistic Regression):  
- Review Count (log)  
- Average Review Word Length  
- Share of Short Reviews  
- Wheelchair Accessibility  
- Table Service  
- Dog-Friendly  
- Price Range  
- Drive-Thru / Delivery (negative impact)  

**Positive Predictors:** Accessibility, comfort, café or dessert types  
**Negative Predictors:** Fast Food, Burgers, long hours, high noise

## 🧭 Clustering Insights (K-Prototypes, k=3)  

| Cluster | Profile | Avg Rating |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **1** | Value-oriented, accessible, family-casual | ⭐ **3.61** |
| **0** | Social, mid-priced casual dining | ⭐ **3.43** |
| **2** | Mid-to-upscale dine-in, premium pricing | ⭐ **3.24** |

**Takeaway:** Comfort, Wi-Fi, consistent hours, and moderate pricing predict higher satisfaction. Upscale restaurants underperform when expectations exceed experience.

## 💡 Discussion & Conclusion  
Structured business metadata can **predict Yelp restaurant ratings** without text analysis.  
Tree-based models capture non-linear interactions across price, amenities, and operational patterns.  
Clustering reveals clear **restaurant archetypes** linked to satisfaction and accessibility.

**Practical Implications:**
- Small businesses can enhance ratings via small operational upgrades (Wi-Fi, accessibility, clearer hours).  
- Metadata models offer interpretable, cost-effective tools for marketing and decision-support.  

### 🔮 Future Work  
- Incorporate **text embeddings** from reviews  
- Integrate **temporal** and **geospatial** context (competition, neighborhood trends)  
- Expand clustering to include dynamic sentiment or image data
